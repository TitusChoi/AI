# Artificial Intelligence
The Artificial Intelligence(AI) Library is a self-contained python(jupyter notebook) library for study.

## Installation
Version : Python 3.7.3<br>
IDE : Jupyter Lab, Microsoft Visual Code, Google Colab<br>

1. Make virtual enviroment.
```sh
python -m venv <your_path>
cd ./<your_path>/Script
activate.bat
```

2. Run .ipynb files.
- Run jupyter notebook.
```sh
pip install jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook
```

- (or) Run jupyter lab(recommended).
```sh
pip install jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook
```

- (or) Run pre-installed vscode.
```sh
code
```

3. Install machine learning python packages.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. If you want to make your development packages, you can proceed as below.
```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Usage
It is possible to learn machine learning fundamentals that directly implement machine learning algorithm.
